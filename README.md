## Paly the game
If you want to play with this game free feel to check out my itch.io profile. 

## Getting Started From Source Code
Currently Project Mineral is based on NebulaPax early version, where the classical Game - Editor - Core structure is not supported yet. So if you want to build this project or NebulaPax itself you need get NebulaPax and this project. After that in the source code you need to give this folder full path.
