# Project Mineral

Project Mineral is a 2D game in NebulaPax. NebulaPax is not supporting the core-editor-game structure yet, thus the engine earlier version is just good for only this game. You can build it if you want, but it will be a huge pain, but if you want to play with the game check out my itch.io page!
